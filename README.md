Team Name: solo-squad

Project Name :  DTSO:Dynamic Traffic Signal Optimization

Theme:Tech for Social Good




Project Description:

	What is it about? 
	
	Dynamic Traffic Signal Optimization (DTSO) is a traffic management system that utilizes real-time data using computer vision and adaptive algorithms to efficiently control traffic signals. Unlike conventional traffic signals with predetermined timing schedules, DTSO systems dynamically adjust signal timings based on current traffic conditions, weather, pedestrian activity, and unforeseen events such as accidents or roadwork. 
	
	What problem does it aim to solve?
	
	DTSO aims for smoother traffic flow at peak hours, reduces congestion, minimize vehicle emissions to promote energy efficient traffic management , reduces travel time which keeps economic efficiency and enhances overall road safety. 
	
	Why is it relevant to the selected theme?
	
	This is relevant to the selected theme Tech for social good as this innovative idea will solve many day to day problems like traffic which is common to all using technology. It is sustainable solution that can improve the city life.

Approach and Vision 

	Describe your approach to developing this project. How do you plan to achieve your goals? Include steps or strategies you intend to follow.
	
	My approach to develop the project is :
	
	Phase 1: Research : define problem
	
	Phase 2: Design and Planning : develop computer vision system to simulate traffic scenarios to test solution
	
	Phase 3: Implementation :launch , test and refine system in real time condition
	
	Phase 4: Scaling and Integration: expand this over city in phases and ensure scalability in future urban growth
	
	Phase 5: Evaluation and Maintenance: monitor the performance of system use machine learning to enhance system capabilities 
	
	To achieve this goal i will need :
	
	Partnership, public awareness, data driven decision making and agile development
